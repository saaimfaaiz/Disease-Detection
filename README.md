 #                 MULTIPLE DISEASE PREDICTION SYSTEM

Multiple Disease Prediction System (MDPS) utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart diseases, Parkinson's disease and diabetes based on patient data. The system integrates diverse datasets encompassing medical history, demographics, lifestyle factors, and clinical indicators to enhance prediction accuracy.

The MDPS employs a multi-step approach starting with data preprocessing to handle missing values, normalization, and feature selection. Subsequently, it utilizes supervised machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), linear regression to train predictive models. Feature importance analysis is conducted to identify the most influential factors contributing to disease prediction.

To evaluate the performance of the MDPS, extensive experiments are conducted on real-world healthcare datasets. The system demonstrates promising results in accurately predicting multiple diseases, including but not limited to cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and Parkinson's disease. Comparative analysis with existing methods showcases the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
